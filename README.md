# QMK Keybindings

These are my own keybindings for QMK keyboards.

## Installation

Set up [qmk](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) per the instructions.

Copy the keymaps desired into the `keyboards` folder at the path in this repo.

**Note:** The Udon13 keyboard isn't in upstream qmk; files can be found [here](https://github.com/The-Mad-Noodle/The-Mad-Noodle-Gen-3-Keypads).
